# Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by fnmatch(3) with the
# FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a / in the pathname. For
# example, "Documentation/*.html" matches "Documentation/git.html" but not
# "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".
