# Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname may have special
# meaning:
#
#  * A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, "**/foo"
#    matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file
#    or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
#
#  * A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside
#    directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
#
#  * A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For
#    example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
#
#  * Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.
