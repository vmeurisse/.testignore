# An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous
# pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of
# that file is excluded. Git doesn't list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns
# on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash ("\") in
# front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example,
# "\!important!.txt".
