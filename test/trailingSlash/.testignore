# If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following description, but it
# would only find a match with a directory. In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and
# paths underneath it, but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent
# with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).
/dir1/
/file1/
